# `interface RetryStrategy`

Defines the strategy for retrying operations that may fail, including the maximum number of retry attempts, the initial delay before the first retry, and the backoff factor applied to the delay between retries.

This interface can be implemented to provide custom retry strategies for operations that require resilience in the face of transient failures.

## Properties

### `val maxAttempts: Int`
- **Description:** The maximum number of attempts to retry an operation before giving up.
- **Details:** This property defines how many times an operation should be retried before it is considered to have failed permanently. If the number of attempts exceeds this value, the operation will not be retried further.

### `val initialDelay: Duration`
- **Description:** The initial delay before the first retry attempt.
- **Details:** This property specifies the amount of time to wait before making the first retry attempt after a failure. The delay may be increased for subsequent retries based on the `backoffFactor`.

### `val backoffFactor: Double`
- **Description:** The factor by which the delay is multiplied after each retry attempt.
- **Details:** This property defines the exponential backoff factor used to increase the delay between each retry attempt. A value greater than 1.0 will result in increasing delays, while a value of 1.0 will keep the delay constant.

## Summary

The `RetryStrategy` interface provides a framework for defining retry behavior, allowing developers to control how often and how long operations should be retried in the event of a failure. By customizing `maxAttempts`, `initialDelay`, and `backoffFactor`, different retry strategies can be implemented to suit various application needs.
